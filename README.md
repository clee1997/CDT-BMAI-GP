# GP Clincial Domain LLM Probing

##Â Overview

This repo contains all of the code that is needed for our GP project. If you want to run the BioLAMA and MedLAMA tasks in this repo with [lm-eval-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) simply follow their instructions for getting setup. Make sure you include the `--include_path` pointing to the location of the task you want to run when running the experiments. We also reccomend using `--output_path` and `--log_samples` so you get lots of data to analyse after the experiment is run!
